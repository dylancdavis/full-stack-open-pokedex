Python, as an interpreted language, doesn't have much of a true build step, and scripts can be run directly. It's common to use a `requirements.txt` file and a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. Though this is really a one-time setup action unrelated to compilation, it's something that's still necessary to include in a "build" pipeline.

Python provides a built-in testing module via its `unittest` module. Sets of tests are defined by inherit from the `unittest.TestCase` class, with individual tests as methods. The class instance offers a variety of assert methods to be called, like `assertEqual(a,b)`. Some frameworks, like Django, offer custom `TestCase` classes than inherit from Python's own.

There are a variety of linting and formatting tools available in Python. Though described as a language support tool, VSCode's default-provided Pylance lints Python code, providing static type checking and other errors and warnings. Flake8 is a popular option built on the `PyFlakes` error checker and `pycodestyle` for code conventions. Another alternative is Black, a highly opinionated formatter (in addition to linter) comparable to Prettier. Ruff is a linter offering both Flake8 and Black support, but highly optimized.

Azure DevOps is another cloud-hosted alternative to GitHub actions, offering repository/branch management, easy pipeline configuration, and release management systems, perhaps in conjunction with Azure App Services. It supports branch policies that can be used to add linting or testing, or even add conditional merging according to test results. Pipelines can also be linked to certain branch updates, allowing them to be automatically run in response to code changes being pushed.
